  "text": "It is contest math. The questions are all proofs. Let s be a finite set of at least two points on the plane. We keep rotating and changing a pivot. There's a very good reason. I mean you look at other Olympiad problems and they often involve some function to analyze or a numerical pattern to deduce may be a difficult counting set up or an elaborate geometric construction, but problem to it's an unusually pure puzzle and in some ways that's it's proving the temp in ischl condition will result in this wind Bill hitting all the points infinitely many times that doesn't test your knowledge of a particular theorem it test if you can find a clever perspective that blade Cuts both ways without resting on an existing result from math, what could possibly prepare someone to study for something like this? They're all hard. Of course. They're challenging and problems 3 and 6. It demands. It asks only for insight. The simplest case would be two points where the line trades off between each point. That works well enough adding a third point. It's pretty clear that the line will just rotate around them. But right now we're just getting a feel for things. The fourth point is where it gets interesting in some places. Super an example like this. It'll be blocked off from those inner points. The line has a blue point on its left. It must happen below the pivot. It must be passing through the same point it started on. I mean think about it if it ended up on some other point, it would change the number on a given side. The line is back where it started and it's hit all of the other points. For the case with an even number of points. Stepping back. It's very easy to fool yourself into thinking that the problem is easier than it is after all. Of course. The number of points on a given side stays constant right course, that's a question. There's one constant. You might consider."
