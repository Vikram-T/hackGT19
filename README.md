To do:

pip install --upgrade google-cloud-speech

pip install --upgrade google-cloud-storage

install python dependencies on requirements_python_mp3totext.txt

install stuff for pydub. Look on pydub github page for needed packages

Note: pydub does not necessarily install the ffmpeg in the right place. You will need to specify the location of the ffmpeg.exe
